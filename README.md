# Capstone-project-Arvato
Steps to Complete This Project
The project has three major steps: the customer segmentation report, the supervised learning model, and the Kaggle Competition.

1. Customer Segmentation Report  
This section will be similar to the corresponding project in Term 1 of the program, but the datasets now  
include more features that we can potentially use. We'll begin the project by using unsupervised learning  
methods to analyze attributes of established customers and the general population in order to create  
customer segments.

2. Supervised Learning Model  
We'll have access to a third dataset with attributes from targets of a mail order campaign. We'll use the  
previous analysis to build a machine learning model that predicts whether or not each individual will   
respond to the campaign.

3. Kaggle Competition  
Once we've chosen a model, we'll use it to make predictions on the campaign data as part of a Kaggle Competition.   
We'll rank the individuals by how likely they are to convert to being a customer, and see how our modeling  
skills measure up against our fellow students.
